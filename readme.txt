when we compile the program

it will show us that key in an input called n.

after we key in the input,the screen will show the input number with a space after it.next,the program will execute continully,we will encounter a while loop.

while the input number is equal to 1,then it will jump out the loop at once,and the program come to an end.

while the input number is not equal to 1,then it will come into the loop and 
begin the next judgement.

   if the remainder of (n/2) is equal to 1,we will assign 3*n+1 to n,and print
       
       out the newest n on the screen.
   
   if the remainder of (n/2) is not equal to 1,we will assign n/2 to n,and print       
       
       out the newest n on the screen.
